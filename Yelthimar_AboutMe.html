		             <p id="aboutme">
		             	My name is Samiksha Yelthimar, and I am a 16-year-old sophomore in high school, with
		             a passion for engineering and finding ways to use technology to simplify common tasks and make our
		             lives more efficient. Engineering as a whole has surrounded me throughout my life, as both of my
		             parents are software engineers working in Silicon Valley, but my interest in engineering developed 
		             when I took Project Lead the Way's (PLTW)  Computer Science/Software Engineering (CSE) elective 
		             in my freshman year of high school (2017-2018). </p>
		             
		              <p id="aboutme">
	 					Though initially I was drawn to the field of computer science due to the early exposure 
	 				I have had to it and the heavy influence various software applications of the 21st century, taking CSE gave 
	 				me my first taste in understanding what it takes to be an engineer. I had the unique opportunity to not only 
	 				generate ideas for games, apps, and websites but to then implement these ideas using the engineering design 
	 				process and the various concepts I learned. Over the course of the year, I became proficient in the use of
	 				programs such as MIT App Inventor, Scratch, GIT Hub, programming languages such as HTML & CSS, Python, PHP, 
	 				JavaScript, and SQL, and concepts regarding cybersecurity and the workings of the internet. I also gained 
	 				valuable insight into planning and managing individual, group, and pair programming projects given constraints, 
	 				guidelines, and deadlines for submission. 
	 				</p>
	 				<p id="aboutme">
						Since I thoroughly enjoyed my first engineering class, I interviewed for the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy
					available at my high school so that I could pursue more engineering courses to broaden my spectrum of interests.
					This year, I am taking PLTW Honors Principles of Engineering (POE). POE has opened my eyes to a world of mechanical, 
					electrical, and science and math-based engineering that I was not aware of. In six short months, I have learned about
					simple machines, breadboarding and multimeter use, electrolysis and the use of solar and hydrogen fuel cells 
					to power cars, and the different energy sources and engineering and engineering technology disciplines.
					Working as a project manager for two projects, I also gained experience in the use of Gantt Charts and 
					decision matrices to plan, divide up tasks, and make decisions effectively.   
					</p>
					<p id="aboutme">
 						As of my sophomore year in high school, my goal is to become a software applications developer, 
 					specifically working in healthcare-related technology. In order to become a software applications developer,
 					I plan to become one through taking various relevant math, science, and engineering courses available to me in 
 					high school and college. After completing CSE and POE by the end of 10th grade, I plan on taking AP Computer
 					Science Applications and a cybersecurity course in my junior and senior years of high school. In addition, 
 					I plan on taking higher-level math and science courses such as AP Calculus AB and BC and AP Chemistry,
 					building on the basic classes I have taken thus far, such as Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II with trigonometry, 
 					Precalculus with Trigonometry, Biology, and Honors Chemistry. Within the field of engineering, perseverance, 
 					commitment to excellence and precision, problem-solving skills, whether interpersonal or conceptual, are 
 					necessities and I aim to have these characteristics. </p>
					
					<p id="aboutme">
						As for my high school year thus far, this is my third semester overall, and I have a 4.13 cumulative GPA and a 4.0 unweighted GPA.
					My GPA includes an A in Sophomore Advanced English, Precalculus with Trigonometry, Honors Chemistry, Honors POE,
					and Spanish 3 through the first semester of 10th grade. On campus, I am a member of the volunteer GiveLight club, 
					California Scholarship Federation (CSF) club, Gael Force Build Club, and the Girls Who Code club this year. Other 
					extracurriculars I participate in include learning Hindi, swimming, and playing the flute. I also love cooking and 
					have started to write a cookbook that I hope I can publish one day.</p>
					
					<p id="aboutme">As a whole, I am someone who is willing to put in the time and effort to learn and perform 
					well in the computer science and engineering field. Thank you for your time, and taking a look through my About page.
                    Please feel free to look around the rest of my website, including my resume, projects, and where to contact me</p>

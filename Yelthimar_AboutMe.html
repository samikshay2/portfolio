		             <p id="aboutme">
		             My name is Samiksha Yelthimar, and I am a 17-year-old junior in high school with a passion for computer science
		             	and finding ways to use technology to simplify common tasks and make our lives more efficient. Engineering as a
		             	whole has surrounded me throughout my life, as both of my parents are software engineers working in Silicon Valley,
		             	but my interest in engineering developed when I took Project Lead the Way's (PLTW) Computer Science Principles (CSP)
		             	elective in my freshman year of high school (2017-2018). </p>
		             
		              <p id="aboutme">
	 					Initially, I was drawn to the field of computer science because of the early exposure I had to it and the 
	 					heavy influence various software applications of the 21st century, but taking CSP gave me my first taste in 
	 					understanding what it takes to be an engineer. I had the unique opportunity to not only generate ideas for
	 					games, apps, and websites but to then implement these ideas using the engineering design process and the various 
	 					concepts I learned that year. Over the course of the year, I became proficient in the use of programs such as MIT
	 					App Inventor, Scratch, and GIT Hub and programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL.
	 					Additionally, I gained valuable knowledge regarding concepts in cybersecurity and the workings of the internet.
	 					Above all, I learned about planning and managing individual, group, and pair programming projects when given 
	 					constraints, guidelines, and deadlines for submission. 
	 				</p>
	 				<p id="aboutme">
						Since I thoroughly enjoyed my first engineering class, I interviewed for the Dublin Engineering and Design
						Academy (DEDA) available at my high school so that I could pursue more engineering courses to broaden my 
						spectrum of interests. This year, I am taking PLTW's Honors Principles of Engineering (POE). POE has opened
						my eyes to a world of mechanics, electronics, aerodynamics, thermodynamics, materials testing, and programming robots
						using VEX Robotics RobotC. In just about ten months, I had learned about simple machines,
						breadboarding and multimeter use, electrolysis and the use of solar and hydrogen fuel cells to power cars, the 
						different energy sources available to use today, aerodynamics and thermodynamics principles, and engineering 
						and engineering technology disciplines. Working as a project manager for three projects, I also gained 
						experience in the use of Gantt Charts and decision matrices to plan, divide up tasks, and make decisions effectively.
						My proudest moment, however, was when my partner and I won second place in my class for the DEDA Entreprenuership 
						Challenge, enabling us to compete in the DEDA Entrepreneurship Showcase that featured a judging panel of
						industry professionals. Using breadboards and programming skills in Arduino, my partner and I built a robot that
						senses flames, then autonomously moves towards it, extinguishes the flames using a fan, and then stops on its own as well.
						I was thrilled to be able to display all the skills I had acquired in the class in a successful project!
					</p>
				    	<p id="aboutme">
						To continue building my foundation in computer science, I enrolled in AP Computer Science Applications my junior year.
						Through this class, I have learned extensively about programming in Java. Some topics I have learned about include:
						 the types of variables (primitives such as integers vs objects such as string, numerical calulations and modular division, 
						parsing strings and getting user input from the scanner class, using if/else if/ else statements, boolean logic and creating
						flag variables, DeMorgan's Law,
						iterating through for loops, creating while loops, using string functions such as .substring(), using 1 and 2D arrays of integers
						and strings, writing void methods with overloaded methods and varying types of parameters, using recursion,and manipulating arraylists.
						All of these skills have enabled me to write complete classes in Java with constructors, JavaDoc comments, multiple
						methods with varying parameters and return types. Through the projects I've completed this year, I have also
						gained experience with using inheritance from parent to child class and interfaces when multiple inheritance is not
						possible or convenient. Lastly, I've created a chatbot using string functions to model natural language processing. 
					</p>
					<p id="aboutme">
 						As of my junior year in high school, my goal is to become a data scientist, specifically
 						working in healthcare-related technology. In order to become a data scientist, I plan to 
 						enroll in various relevant math, science, and engineering courses available to me in high school
 						and college. As I have completed CSP and POE in grades 9 and 10, I am currently taking AP Computer Science Applications.
 						In addition, am currently taking AP Calculus AB and AP Chemistry, building on the basic classes I have taken
 						thus far, such as Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II with trigonometry, Precalculus with Trigonometry, Biology, and Honors 
 						Chemistry. I plan on taking other higher-level math and science courses as well, such as AP Calculus BC, AP Statistics, and AP Physics.
						Within the field of engineering, perseverance, commitment to excellence and precision, problem-solving skills,
 						whether interpersonal or conceptual, are necessities and I aim to have these characteristics. </p>
					
					<p id="aboutme">
						As for my high school year thus far, this is my fifth semester overall, and I have a 4.32 cumulative GPA and a 4.0 unweighted GPA.
					My GPA includes an A in AP Calculus AB, AP Chemistry, AP Computer Science Applications, AP English Language and Composition
					and AP Spanish Language and Culture through the first semester of 11th grade. On campus, I am the secretary-treasurer of the environmental 
					protection club DHS ECO club, member of the volunteer GiveLight club, 
					California Scholarship Federation (CSF) club, Gael Force Build Club, and the Girls Who Code club this year. Other 
					extracurriculars I participate in include being a part of Dublin High's Gael Force Robotics Club as a member of
					Competition Team 5327Z, learning Hindi, swimming, and playing the flute. I also love cooking and 
					have started to write a cookbook that I hope I can publish one day.</p>
					
					<p id="aboutme">As a whole, I am someone who is willing to put in the time and effort to learn and perform 
					well in the computer science and engineering field. Thank you for your time, and taking a look through my About page.
                    Please feel free to look around the rest of my website, including my resume, projects, and where to contact me</p>

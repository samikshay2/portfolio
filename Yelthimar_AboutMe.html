		           	 <h3 class="welcome"> Hi, my name is Samiksha Yelthimar. Welcome to my Web Page!</h3>
		             <p id="aboutme"> My goal is to become a software applications
		             developer, and I plan to become one through taking various relevant math, science, and engineering
		             courses. Currently, I am a freshman in high school, and I am taking computer 
		             science/software engineering as my elective. I plan on applying for the engineering academy 
		             at my school, which would allow me to take principles of engineering in 10th grade
		             and AP computer science applications in 11th grade. In addition, I plan on taking higher level
		             science and math courses. This is my career goal, because I love coding and working with computers.</p>

					<p id="aboutme">Three aspects that I deem are most important in the field of computer science  is perseverance, commitment to excellence and precision, and an understanding
					that problem solving takes time and effort. I have constantly challenged myself throughout 
					middle and high school taking courses that challenge me, and taking such classes has brought
					out the best and worst of me, but regardless helped make me the person I am today. Taking 
					Algebra 1 in 8th grade was difficult, both in terms of keeping up with the homework, tests, 
					and simultaneously learning the subject matter. However, through doing poorly on the first test, 
					I learned that solving problems and learning the subject matter takes more than just doing the 
					homework on time; it takes extra time and effort. I also learned how important 
				    it is to persevere,
					and that if I put in the effort to attain excellence, I would definitely improve,
					which I did. This overall process has prepared me for the challenges 
					involved a field such computer science.</p>
					
					<p id="aboutme">This is my first semester of high school, and thus far I have a 4.0 GPA (I am not taking any
					weighted courses as of yet). My GPA includes an A in Freshman Advanced English and Algebra II 
					with Trignometry. I also am a member of the volunteer club, LIVE club, and plan on getting 
					involved in the California Schlarship Federation (CSF) Club and Key Club starting second
					semester of this year. </p>
					
					<p id="aboutme">As a whole, I am someone who is willing to put in the time and effort to learn and perform
					well in the computer science field. Thank you so much for your time, and taking a look through my webpage.
					Please feel free to look around the rest of my website, including my resume, projects,
					and where to contact me.</p>

		             <p> In the Scratch Project, we had to create an original game of our choice. This was a two person project, and I was co-lead in the project. 
		                 My partner for this project and I, thought that a boat-themed game could be very interesting if we added obstacles of varying difficulties. 
		                 We also wanted to add multiple levels to this game, and give the player the choice to decide what level they want to start on. I focused strongly
		                 on the design, and making this game engaging through the use of various obstacles, such as sharks and oil spills. The objective of our game was to pass each level
		                 as fast as you can. If you hit the borders, or an obstacle, you will be prompted to start over from the beginning. It was difficult making all of the sprites to work 
		                 as intented, especially working in the new Scratch environment, but we figured it out through trying over and over again. We created a Project Design Notebook that is linked
		                 under the section for project documentation. I learned various skills, including programming samples for computer science (Scratch Programming Environment), and creating a Project Design Notebook for engineering,

		             <p> In the MIT APP Inventor Project, we had to Improve, enhance, and add more features to a tutorial game of intermediate-advanced difficulty level. 
		                 This was a two person project, and I was co-lead in the project. 
		                 My partner for this project and I, thought that we could improve the Space Invaders game we were assigned by making the obstacles the rocket needs to dodge fall 
		                 from the top of the screen, reduce the score if the rocket touches the obstacles, make the rocket shoot the obstacles, make the rocket 
		                 shoot multiple bullets instead of one, and add new sprites. 
		                 I focused strongly only the design aspect once again.
		                 It was difficult making all of the sprites to work 
		                 as intented, especially working in the new MIT App Inventor environment, but we figured it out through trying over and over again. We created a Project Design Notebook that is linked

		             <br>
		             <p> In the Image Manipulation, we had to create an image manipulation program that would run against a large number of files in a directory. 
		             	 This was a two person project, and I was co-lead in the project. 
		                 My partner for this project and I, thought that a making the images all the same size, black and white, adding a border with a geometric accent, 
		                 some symbols, and a nametag would make the images nice. 
		                 We also wanted to give the client options for who they wanted to change the image - a girl or a boy. I focused strongly
		                 on the design, deciding how exactly to change the images. I also wrote much of the code for the different manipulations and making a python "for" loop
		                 that iterates through all images in a directory. It was difficult getting the "for" loop to correctly loop through all the images, but my partner and I referenced
		                 past assignments from class that ultimately helped us get through the technical difficulties.
		                 We created a Project Design Notebook that is linked above,
		                 under the section for project documentation. I learned various skills, including programming samples (in Python) 
		                 for computer science, and creating a Project Design Notebook for engineering.

		             		The goal of the Scratch Project was to create an original game of our choice using the coding program Scratch.
                          This was a two person project, and I was the lead in the project. Our game is inspired by boats and their voyages 
                          and allows the player to move the boat from the start point to the endpoint while facing obstacles of varying difficulties.
                          The objective of our game is to pass each level as fast as you can. If you hit the borders or an obstacle, you will be 
                          prompted to start over from the beginning.
                         The game also features multiple levels to this game, and give the player the choice to decide what level they want to start on. I focused strongly
                         on the coding of the design and sprites, making this game engaging through the use of various obstacles, such as sharks and oil spills.
                         It was difficult making all of the sprites to work 
                         as intended, especially working in the new Scratch environment, but after consulting related Scratch programs and trial 
                         and error, we were able to work around the issues.
                         We created a Project Design Notebook that is linked under the section for project documentation. I learned various skills,
                         including programming samples for computer science in the Scratch Programming Environment, game development in particular,
                         and creating a Project Design Notebook for engineering.

		             <br>
		             <p> The goal of the MIT App Inventor Project was to improve, enhance, and add more features to a given tutorial 
		             game of intermediate-advanced difficulty level in the MIT App Inventor environment. This was a pair programming project,
		             and I was co-lead in the project.  My partner and I were given the basic code for a space-themed game, which had a static 
		             rocket shoot at a horizontally moving saucer shaped obstacle it had to dodge. We decided to improve the game we were assigned by making the obstacles the rocket needed to dodge fall 
 					from the top of the screen, reduce the score if the rocket touched these obstacles, make the rocket shoot the obstacles to 
 					avoid them, make the rocket shoot multiple bullets at a time instead of one, and add new sprites to the existing game. 
                         I focused strongly on the code for making the rocket shoot at the obstacles, adding and designing new sprites, and
                         making the rocket shoot multiple bullets. The major difficulties I ran into in this project, besides getting adapted to 
                         the MIT App Inventor environment which was new to me, was
                         making sure what we coded transferred exactly to the player's app on the tablet in terms of functionality and aesthetics.
                         We created a Project Design Notebook that is linked under the section for project documentation. 
                         I learned various skills, including programming samples for computer science (MIT App Inventor Environment), app development particular.

		             <br>
		             <p> The goal of the Python Image Manipulation Project was to create an image manipulation program that would make standard changes
                          to a large number of images of varying sizes in a selected directory. 
                          This was a two person project, and I was the leader of the project. 
                         I decided that making the all of the images the same size, black and white, adding a border with a geometric accent, 
                         adding some personalized symbols, and adding a nametag would make the images customized. 
                         We also wanted to give the client options for whom they wanted to change the image for - a girl or a boy. 
                         For this project, I wrote the code for the different manipulations (making it black and white, adding the geometric accented border adding the symbols, and adding the nametag) and making a python "for" loop that iterates through all images in a directory. It was difficult getting the "for" loop to correctly loop through all the images,
                         but my partner and I referenced past assignments from our class that ultimately helped us get through the technical difficulties.
                         We created a Project Design Notebook that is linked above,
                         under the section for project documentation. I learned various skills, including programming samples (in Python) 
                         for computer science, specifically in regards to variable roles.

		             <p> The goal of the Solar-Hydrogen Vehicle Project was to design, create, and test a prototype of a vehicle that uses a solar module and/or fuel 
						 cell as its sole power source. This prototype would then be used used to gather information about different energy source combinations to 
						 formulate a recommendation for optimum power generation. For this project, there were four total power source configurations needed,
						 one with a single solar cell, one with a single hydrogen cell, one with two solar cells, and one with two hydrogen cells. However, there
						 were constraints for this project, including the dimensions (the top view of the vehicle could be no larger than 5 inches by 12 inches),
						 only VEX Robotics parts could be used to build the vehicle, the vehicle should have been able to hold the solar module or hydrogen fuel 
						 cell securely and run without tipping the fuel cell, it must use a breadboard to easily change between power source configurations, and 
						 there was a time limit of 16 days. For this project, I wired the four configurations of the breadboard, including making a parallel and 
						 series circuit for the double cell configurations. In addition, I revised our initial design sketch to optimize the torque of the vehicle 
						 over speed and make the vehicle more efficient by reducing the parts of the vehicle that increased weight and friction. Charging the 
						 hydrogen cells, recording measurements, and doing the calculations for work, input electrical power, output mechanical power, and 
						 efficiency were also among my tasks. Lastly, I was the project manager for this project and planned the timeline of this project using
						 a Gantt chart. Some skills I learned through this project were prototyping a vehicle, breadboard configurations, multimeter usage, and
						 project management skills (Gantt chart and decision matrices).

		             <br>
		             <p> For this project, the goal for each designer was to design, build, and test two projectiles, one to be launched on each of the two launch days. 
						The objective was to make a projectile travel the farthest lateral distance while satisfying the constraints.
                     These prototypes would then be used used to gather information about which designs and launch angles would produce projectiles that would fly the furthest.
                      For this project, there were six total projectiles needed, with each group member designing two unique projectiles. However, there were
                      some constraints limiting the materials we could use and the variables we could influence, including that the entire projectile had to be
                     paper and tape-based only, the body diameter must fit over a ¾ inch PVC pipe and have a length between 10”-15”, the wingspan must be less than 24”, and the
                     projectile is to be launched at specified psi with provided rocket launcher. We, as the designers could choose the angle of launch, which could be in the range 0 degrees < angle < 90 degrees.
                     When it came to designing my two projectiles, I modeled my two designs after most traditional rockets, featuring a cylindrical body, 
                     three to four wings spaced equidistant from each other, a nose cone with a pointy apex, and a pressure cap. 
                     Made completely out of cardstock, my prototypes were aimed at being as sturdy as possible while launched straight up into the air.
                     However, the cardstock was significantly heavier than printer paper, and to offset the weight, packing tape was used throughout the design as the adhesive to attach all the parts of the rocket. The packing tape was a strong adhesive, more durable compared to the everyday use one-inch tape, but was thinner and lighter than the duct tape. As for the design of the rocket’s four main components 
                     (the body, cone, pressure cap, and wings), similar approaches were taken for each of the four. My first rocket, launched at 60 PSI and 45°, traveled 65 yards (195 feet)  laterally in 3.10 seconds. My second rocket, launched at 60 PSI and 45°, traveled 53 yards (159 feet) laterally in 3.61 seconds.
                     Upon analyzing the results of the launches, I learned that skinnier wings and nose cones minimize drag, thus maximizing lateral distance. I also found the
                     ideal launch range to be between 30 and 40 degrees when comparing my two projectiles with my teammates' projectiles.
                     Lastly, I was the project manager for this project and planned the timeline of this project using a Gantt chart. Some skills I learned through this project were designing projectiles, using a projectile launcher, and calculating initial, vertical, and 
                     horizontal velocities and calculating vertical and horizontal displacement

				learning game. The aim of our game is to both successfully reach 400 points and answer the 
				follow-up Spanish questions correctly. The player begins with 0 points and earns 90 points 
				upon moving the cart to successfully catch the lemons. If the player moves the cart and it touches a bomb, they lose 90 points. The player must be aware however, that the bombs and lemons pop up in random locations and fall at varying speeds. If the player successfully reaches 400 points, he or she will get to choose between 4 different Spanish topics including colors, numbers, verbs, and vocabulary words. Upon deciding which area they would like to review, the player will get asked a series of 3 questions and feedback to these questions will be printed to the console. If all questions are answered correctly, the game will end. Conversely, if the player reaches negative points, as a penalty they must answer the three questions as well. If the player is a stellar student and would like to review a second topic the game also gives them that opportunity. 
		  		The summer homework topics we used were Boolean operators and logic,  Java library classes 
				     such as Math, nested if-else statements, string functions and operations, and static 
				     variables and methods (static final int). We used string functions mainly to create a 
				     question and answer interaction where we first ask the user what topic of spanish they
				     want to practice. The topics we ask for them to choose from are: colors, numbers,
				     vocabulary, or verbs (all in Spanish). After they pick a topic, we ask 3 questions
				     related to it. The if - else statements were used inside the string functions 
				     to ask a series of questions and based on user input, providing a different response 
				     based on user’s selection. The Math.random method was used to create random behavior
				     and create a more challenging, unpredictable behavior, such as slowing down the 
				     speed of the lemons as they fall. This way the user has a higher chance of catching 
				     the bomb and having to answer the questions. The boolean functions were used mainly 
				     to implement a set of code that runs once the cart touches the lemons or the bombs. 
				     Finally, the static int constant variable was implemented to prevent any erratic 
				     behavior in movement when the user moves the cart left and right. Overall, I learned several 
				     AP CSA Java concepts through this project.

		             <p> The app that I  built is called the Healthy Heart Helper. This app is intended to
				     help people stay informed about their health habits and track their daily nutrition, 
				     while giving advice on how to stay healthy. My design plan consisted of the 
				     login screen and three activity screen without a settings screen. The current state 
				     of the project
				     consists of 4 activity screens. The activity screens are a login screen, Settings
				     menu, nutrition advice screen, and exercise tips screen. The login screen is an 
				     activity with a simple layout consisting of the username and password to go to the 
				     next screen. The settings screen is a simple layout where there are switches for dark 
				     mode, vibrate option, and a checkbox for saving preferences. There is also an about
				     section listing the version of android studio the app is using. The following 
				     screen is a nutrition advice screen where there’s a checklist of healthy habits the
				     user should follow and gives them a proper nutrition checklist. The final screen 
				     is the exercise tips screen where it lists the type of exercises are recommended 
				     to the user based on their demographic (age). These screens are connected and able
				     to go from one activity screen to the other by using buttons through the implementation
				     of intents. The challenges we had were in the process of switching from one activity 
				     screen to the other because there were many compiling errors. In addition, we had 
				     trouble with Android Studio running smoothly because we often ran into errors with 
				     the emulator, build grade file, compiling code without errors, and using linear layout
				     without the app crashing. We eventually fixed these problems by invalidating the caches 
				     and restarting, deleting the build.gradle file, creating new activities inside the 
				     resources file, and merging the code through Android Studio.

		             <p> In this project, I familiarized myself with Jupyter Notebook, among the leading software applications
				  used by data analysts and data scientists. I learned that Jupyter Notebook is used to
				  develop open-source software,  open-standards, and services for interactive computing 
				  across dozens of programming languagesopen. It is an open source web application used to 
				  create and share documents with live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
				  Some common uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, 
				   statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning. As part of my demo application,
				   I used data in the form of a csv file containing information about movies and created several
				   statistical models and graphs to extrapolate insights from the data. This was a great introduction
				   to an important platform used heavily by data scientists.

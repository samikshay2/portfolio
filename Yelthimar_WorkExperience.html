		             	Since I joined Dublin High School's Dublin Engineering and Design Academy (DEDA), I have 
		             	had the opportunity to not only enrich my understanding of engineering through learning key 
		             	concepts in computer science, software engineering, cybersecurity, mechanical,electrical, aerospace, 
				 software, and materials engineering and getting hands-on experience by working on projects, but also through attending field trips and guest
		             	speaker presentations. I had always been fascinated by astronomy and biomedical engineering, 
		             	but after getting the chance to go on a field trip to NASA Ames and listen to a biomedical 
		             	engineer on his journey in genetic engineering, my interest in engineering as a whole grew substantially.

	 					Last summer shortly after the school year ended, on June 5, 2018, I had the incredible 
	 					opportunity to visit the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. The first 
	 					field trip opportunity I received after being accepted into DEDA, I was intrigued by the 
	 					possibility of revisiting NASA Ames.  As a long-time astronomy and aerodynamics enthusiast,
	 					I had already visited NASA Ames once before in the sixth grade when they had opened their 
	 					facilities for their seventy-fifth anniversary. Additionally, I had visited Johnson Space
	 					Center in Houston, Texas thrice. However, when visiting both Ames and Johnson Space Center, 
	 					I wasn't able to fully grasp the magnitude of innovation, creativity, and thought that went
	 					into all that made flight and rockets possible. I was just a ten or twelve-year-old who
	 					didn't have much experience in engineering or advanced sciences. When I went to Ames again 
	 					as a fifteen-year-old with much more experience in engineering, math, and science, my whole 
	 					view of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics changed. At Ames, I met a scientist who worked at the
	 					fluid dynamics lab and a scientist who worked with the wind tunnels where the air crafts
	 					would be tested or simulated. I learned about how liquids could be used to model the behavior
	 					of fluids. In particular, the scientist explained why increased surface area causes more drag. 
	 					However, I was most interested in their simulation, in which they had liquids in a tank with 
	 					another object, such as a model plane, and added colors and UV lights to show how air and objects
	 					in the air would affect that object. This experience at NASA Ames made me develop a greater
	 					understanding of fluid dynamics and aerodynamics, helping tremendously during the aerodynamics
	 					unit in POE this year. Visiting NASA Ames was one of the best experiences of my life!

	 					In the fall of my sophomore year of high school (2018-2019), Aaron Pomerantz, a biomedical 
	 					engineer explained how he traveled to South America to find solutions to deforestation, to 
	 					easily identify animals, and to conduct testing with Crispr. From Pomerantz's presentation, 
	 					I learned that even as technology is improving, the natural world is dying, as we are losing 
	 					species at a higher rate than ever before. To combat this, Pomerantz worked with Oxford Nanopore 
	 					Technology, a fast, portable, and easily accessible DNA sequencer, to identify and store the DNA 
	 					of animals. In addition, Pomerantz also introduced me to Crispr, which cuts DNA to observe functions 
	 					or change DNA sequences. After being introduced to DNA sequencing in biology as a freshman,
	 					Pomerantz's presentation helped expand my knowledge in the field of biomedical engineering and grow 
	 					my interest in genetics as a whole.

	 					In the fall of my junior year, I had the privilege of being able to listen to a talk by Jason Yosinski,
						who is a computer scientist specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning for robots at Uber AI Labs. 
						Yosinski's interesting perspective on natural language processing and using neural networks to teach a robot to run by itself inspired 
						me to research more about the applications of AI today. I learned that AI refers to creating intelligent machines and that 
						machine learning refers to a particular type of AI that trains a machine to evolve and output increasingly accurate responses.
						This AI can be used to train robots, though such methods are also extremely inefficient. One form of machine learning that 
						is being increasingly used, however, is neural network training, which essentially entails telling the machine what the
						right answer is to then move the wrong answer increasingly close to the right one. This process often using calculus principles
						such as derivation and matrix multiplication to output the probability of the machine accurately identifying or outputting
						a response. Yosinski also explained that neural networks have allowed speech and image recognition. As a whole,
						Yosinski's presentation broadened my horizons to the basics of AI and machine learning.

		             	Since I joined Dublin High School's Dublin Engineering and Design Academy (DEDA), I have 
		             	had the opportunity to not only enrich my understanding of engineering through learning key 
		             	concepts in computer science, software engineering, cybersecurity, mechanical,electrical, aerospace, 
				 software, and materials engineering and getting hands-on experience by working on projects, but also through attending field trips and guest
		             	speaker presentations.

	 					As a part of the Engineering Academy, I had the chance to go on numerous field trips. In the summer of 2018, I had the  
	 					opportunity to visit the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. The first 
	 					field trip opportunity I received after being accepted into DEDA, I was intrigued by the 
	 					possibility of revisiting NASA Ames.  As a long-time astronomy and aerodynamics enthusiast,
	 					Visiting Ames was a dream come true. At Ames, I met a scientist who worked at the
	 					fluid dynamics lab and a scientist who worked with the wind tunnels where the air crafts
	 					would be tested or simulated. I learned about how liquids could be used to model the behavior
	 					of fluids and about the principles of aerodynamics. This experience at NASA Ames made me develop a greater
	 					understanding of fluid dynamics and aerodynamics. Visiting NASA Ames was one of the best
				      		experiences of my life! A couple months later, in October, I participated in the Tri-Valley manufacturing day event, where I got to 
				    		visit manufacturing companies located in the Tri-Valley area in the East Bay such as LAM Research and AMP Printing. There, we got 
				     		an inside look on how common every day objects and large, industrial-scale machines are made. I was particularly intrigued by the huge 
				      		printers at AMP Printing that helped create signs for professional sporting events. It was highly informative to see how some seemingly basic items 
				      		are brought to life by engineerings. Similar to Manufacturing Day, in 2021, I attended Roche Molecular's Career Day presentation. 
				      		The over the past couple of months, the biotechnology and medical fields have been at the forefront of the news, fueled by 
				      		the dire need for tests and vaccines for the coronavirus. At this event, I learned how scientists at Genentech and Roche worked together to develop
				     		a rapid result coronavirus test. The scientists in the panel explained how coronaviruses are large enveloped positive strong ran viruses
				     		that are primarily transmitted through host animals like bats. So, to create the SarsCov2 diagnostic test, they
				     		Polymerase chain reaction mechanism that utilizes a biochemical reaction caused by the presence of the virus. Futhermore, while these three field 
				     		trips helped me develop my knowledge base and gain some perspective on the real-world applications of the concepts I'm studying now, I also had the 
				     		chance to go on a field trip to UC Davis. There, I got my on and, unfortunately due to COVID-19, only offical college campus tour. This was especially useful
				      		since I had never been to a large university campus before, and I got to learn first hand what the admissions requirements are and get a feel of the campus overall.
				     		This experience helped me immensely this past summer and fall as I applied to UC Davis and other UC campuses.

						Over the course of my four years in high school, I've had the chance to sit in on several informational and enlightening guest speaker 
						presentations. The two most notable guest speaker events I attended were ones by Aaron Pomerantz and Jason Yosinski.
	 					In the fall of my sophomore year of high school, Aaron Pomerantz, a biomedical 
	 					engineer explained how he used with Crispr to improve deforestation. From Pomerantz's presentation, 
	 					I learned that even as technology is improving, the natural world is dying, as we are losing 
	 					species at a higher rate than ever before. To combat this, Pomerantz worked with Oxford Nanopore 
	 					Technology, a fast, portable, and easily accessible DNA sequencer, to identify and store the DNA 
	 					of animals.  Pomerantz's presentation helped expand my knowledge in the field of biomedical engineering and grow 
	 					my interest in genetics as a whole.  Moreover, in the fall of my junior year,  Jason Yosinski,
						 a computer scientist specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning for robots at Uber AI Labs gave a 
						came to my school to give us a presentation.Yosinski's interesting perspective on natural language processing and using neural networks to teach a robot to run by itself inspired 
						me to research more about the applications of AI today. I learned that AI refers to creating intelligent machines and that 
						machine learning refers to a particular type of AI that trains a machine to evolve and output increasingly accurate responses.
						This AI can be used to train robots, though such methods are also extremely inefficient. One form of machine learning that 
						is being increasingly used, however, is neural network training, which essentially entails telling the machine what the
						right answer is to then move the wrong answer increasingly close to the right one. This process often using calculus principles
						such as derivation and matrix multiplication to output the probability of the machine accurately identifying or outputting
						a response. Yosinski also explained that neural networks have allowed speech and image recognition. As a whole,
						Yosinski's presentation broadened my horizons to the basics of AI and machine learning, which is a field that deeply intrigues
						me and I would like to be a part of in the future.

						Furthermore, in the fall of my junior year, I participated in the Engineering Academy's Mentorship Program. 
						Through this program, I worked closely with an industry professional to develop the technical, professional, and 
						networking skills needed to excel in the software and technology industry. I was paired with 
						Hitesh Parashar, a software engineer and CEO of a start-up, Astellent. Through the Mentorship Program, the three main skills I learned that have greatly 
						helped me secure top level internships and summer programs, include setting goals, interviewing for success, and networking with other industry professionals.
						With Hitesh's help, I outlined SMART goals that I wanted to achieve in my junior and senior years, focusing on planning the small steps needed to achieve a bigger goal.
						I also did a couple mock interviews with him, which helped me refine my interviewing skills so that I could put my best self forward when actually interviewing for 
						companies such as Cisco. Lastly, learning to network with other adults and learning how to hold a conversation professionally came with experience for me through the 
						several career day round-robins we had.  Around the same time, I also was encouraged by my mentor to venture into more hands-on programs and classes. So, in October and November 2019, I was accepted to UC Berkeley's Big Data Bootcamp hosted at Barrow's Hall.The Big Data 
						Bootcamp at UC Berkeley is one of the most intellectually stimulating and informational experiences, and was my first introduction into 
						Data Science, a field I intend on studying in college. I’ve grown to love math, science, and computer science, but
						I wasn’t quite sure exactly where I fit. Upon taking this bootcamp, however, the decision became clearer. At the Big 
						Data bootcamp, I was introduced to the rapidly-expanding world of data science, and I learned and gained hands on 
						experiences working with the fundamentals of programming in python, analyzing data and biases with python, and using
						Jupyter notebook. Additionally, through this bootcamp, I gained valuable problem-solving and critical thinking skills,
						data and file management skills, and was able to get the experience working and commuting to and from a busy university
						campus.

	 					In the summer after my junior year, I continued to explore the interesction between engineering and entrepreneurship. To do so, 
						I interned at Cisco Systems, Inc. at the San Jose, CA location, as a part of their selective Cisco High School Externship
						programs. This marked my first work experience in a professional setting. Cisco is one of the largest and most influential networking hardware companies in Silicon Valley that has
						a huge outreach in the business and hardware and software engineering fields, and through this externship, 
						I was able to immerse myself into the world of software development and entrepreneurship. I  
						established a strong foundation in the fundamentals of programming, networking, cybersecurity, by participating in numerous 
						workshops, including the Cisco Networking Academy courses Introduction to Internet of Things and Introduction to Networking. I 
						also developed a prototype app and modeled a paired device that work together to help with COVID contact tracing
						and a social distancing as part of my Capstone Project for the internship. 
						Futhermore, I continued to grow my skillset by participating in a Kode With Klossy Summer Bootcamp. I was a part of the web 
						development curriculum and learned the structure, design, and behavior of websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
						For my capstone project, I put my skills to action and led my team to create an interactive climate change educational resource
						for elementary school children. Finally, this summer I co-founded a volunteer organization called DubLearn Academy in my community.
						With some of my peers, I created a free virtual 2-week summer camp to help educate 25 elementary and middle school students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
						I planned classes in math, science, english, coding, and dance, and created a comprehensive introductory coding curriculum in web development.
						At the same time, I launched a fundraiser to garner donations from camp attendees and collected over $600 and 6000 meals to be donated to Feeding America’s COVID-19 fund. 
						
				   </p>
						<p id="aboutme">
						From here, I see college as the next step. As of March 2021, I do not know which university I'll be heading to in the fall, but I 
						fully intend on majoring in Computer Science (or a very closely related subject) and potentially doing a second major in computational biology or genetics.
						If not a second major, I'd like to minor in entrepreneurship, to grow my skills across the different fields.

		             	Since I joined Dublin High School's Dublin Engineering and Design Academy (DEDA), I have 
		             	had the opportunity to not only enrich my understanding of engineering through learning key 
		             	concepts in computer science, software engineering, cybersecurity, mechanical,electrical, aerospace, 
				 software, and materials engineering and getting hands-on experience by working on projects, but also through attending field trips and guest
		             	speaker presentations.

	 					In the summer of 2018, I had the incredible 
	 					opportunity to visit the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. The first 
	 					field trip opportunity I received after being accepted into DEDA, I was intrigued by the 
	 					possibility of revisiting NASA Ames.  As a long-time astronomy and aerodynamics enthusiast,
	 					I had already visited NASA Ames once before in the sixth grade when they had opened their 
	 					facilities for their seventy-fifth anniversary. Additionally, I had visited Johnson Space
	 					Center in Houston, Texas thrice. However, when I went to Ames again 
	 					as a fifteen-year-old with much more experience in engineering, math, and science, my whole 
	 					view of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics changed. At Ames, I met a scientist who worked at the
	 					fluid dynamics lab and a scientist who worked with the wind tunnels where the air crafts
	 					would be tested or simulated. I learned about how liquids could be used to model the behavior
	 					of fluids and about the principles of aerodynamics. This experience at NASA Ames made me develop a greater
	 					understanding of fluid dynamics and aerodynamics,Visiting NASA Ames was one of the best
				      		experiences of my life!

	 					In the fall of my sophomore year of high school (2018-2019), Aaron Pomerantz, a biomedical 
	 					engineer explained how he traveled to South America to find solutions to deforestation, to 
	 					easily identify animals, and to conduct testing with Crispr. From Pomerantz's presentation, 
	 					I learned that even as technology is improving, the natural world is dying, as we are losing 
	 					species at a higher rate than ever before. To combat this, Pomerantz worked with Oxford Nanopore 
	 					Technology, a fast, portable, and easily accessible DNA sequencer, to identify and store the DNA 
	 					of animals. In addition, Pomerantz also introduced me to Crispr, which cuts DNA to observe functions 
	 					or change DNA sequences. After being introduced to DNA sequencing in biology as a freshman,
	 					Pomerantz's presentation helped expand my knowledge in the field of biomedical engineering and grow 
	 					my interest in genetics as a whole.
	 				</p>
				   
				        <p id="aboutme">
	 					In the fall of my junior year, I had the privilege of being able to listen to a talk by Jason Yosinski,
						who is a computer scientist specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning for robots at Uber AI Labs. 
						Yosinski's interesting perspective on natural language processing and using neural networks to teach a robot to run by itself inspired 
						me to research more about the applications of AI today. I learned that AI refers to creating intelligent machines and that 
						machine learning refers to a particular type of AI that trains a machine to evolve and output increasingly accurate responses.
						This AI can be used to train robots, though such methods are also extremely inefficient. One form of machine learning that 
						is being increasingly used, however, is neural network training, which essentially entails telling the machine what the
						right answer is to then move the wrong answer increasingly close to the right one. This process often using calculus principles
						such as derivation and matrix multiplication to output the probability of the machine accurately identifying or outputting
						a response. Yosinski also explained that neural networks have allowed speech and image recognition. As a whole,
						Yosinski's presentation broadened my horizons to the basics of AI and machine learning, which is a field that deeply intrigues
						me and I would like to be a part of in the future.
						
						Furthermore, in October and November 2019, I was accepted to UC Berkeley's Big Data Bootcamp hosted at Barrow's Hall.The Big Data 
						Bootcamp at UC Berkeley is one of the most intellectually stimulating and informational experiences that I have been a 
						part of in my three years of being an engineering student. I’ve grown to love math, science, and computer science, but
						I wasn’t quite sure exactly where I fit. Upon taking this bootcamp, however, the decision became clearer. At the Big 
						Data bootcamp, I was introduced to the rapidly-expanding world of data science, and I learned and gained hands on 
						experiences working with the fundamentals of programming in python, analyzing data and biases with python, and using
						Jupyter notebook. Additionally, through this bootcamp, I gained valuable problem-solving and critical thinking skills,
						data and file management skills, and was able to get the experience working and commuting to and from a busy university
						campus.
	 				</p>
				        <p id="aboutme">
	 					Now, heading into my senior year of high school, I'm excited for all the opportunities to grow my skills that lie ahead.
						Starting April 2020, I will be an extern at Cisco Systems, Inc. at the San Jose, CA location. I was one of 12 highly
						talented Bay Area high school students offered the position of extern at this prestigious and expremely competitive
						externships. isco is one of the largest and most influential networking hardware companies in Silicon Valley that has
						a huge outreach in the business and hardware and software engineering fields. Through this externship, 
						I will be able to immerse myself into the world of software development and entrepreneurship 
						and establish a strong foundation in the fundamentals of programming, networking, cybersecurity, 
						and entrepreneurship. This summer, I will also be taking courses at my community college online to supplement my 
						learning of related fields. I will be enrolling in Introduction to Nutrition Science and Environmental
						Geology: Hazards. Nutrition and geology have long interested me and are growing fields of research.
